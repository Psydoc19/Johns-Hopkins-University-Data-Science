# Statistical Analysis Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to a two-part statistical analysis project aimed at applying and demonstrating key statistical concepts through practical exercises and analysis.

## Project Parts

### Part 1: Simulation Exercise

In the first part of the project, we delve into simulating the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the principles of the Central Limit Theorem. The task involves simulating the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials, a thousand times, to explore and illustrate:

-   The sample mean and its comparison to the theoretical mean.
-   The variability of the sample through variance and its comparison to the theoretical variance.
-   The approximation of the distribution to normality, especially when comparing the distribution of a large collection of random exponentials to the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials.

### Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis

The second part of the project focuses on the analysis of the `ToothGrowth` dataset from R's datasets package. The objectives include:

-   Conducting basic exploratory data analyses to understand the dataset.
-   Summarizing the data through basic statistical measures.
-   Using confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supplement type (`supp`) and dosage (`dose`), strictly adhering to the techniques discussed in class.
-   Drawing conclusions from the analyses and outlining the assumptions made during the process.

## Reporting

Participants are expected to create detailed reports for both parts of the project, adhering to the following guidelines:

-   Each PDF report should not exceed 3 pages, with an allowance for an additional 3 pages of supporting appendix material if necessary (code, figures, etc.).
-   Reports should be generated ideally using `knitr` to seamlessly integrate R code and output into the report, though other software can be used to create the PDF if preferred.

## Grading Criteria Overview

The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   The ability to correctly identify and compare the central tendencies and variabilities of the distributions to their theoretical counterparts.
-   The effectiveness of the exploratory data analysis in highlighting key features of the dataset.
-   The accuracy and relevance of the confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests performed.
-   The correct interpretation of the results within the context of the given problems.
-   The clarity in describing the assumptions necessary for the conclusions reached.

Participants are encouraged to rewatch specific lecture videos for a refresher on how to approach the project, ensuring a comprehensive and well-structured report.
